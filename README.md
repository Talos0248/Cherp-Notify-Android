# Cherp Notify: The Android Version!
Cherp unread notifications, delivered straight to your Android device!

### FAQ

Q: Why does play protect say that the app is unsafe?
A: The app hasn't been signed, thus Google Play doesn't recognize it. To install, tap 'more details' and then 'install anyways'.

Q: Wait wait wait, is this malware if Google says it's unsafe????
A: You have my 100% guarantee that this isn't a malware/virus. However, the code itself might be buggy/unoptimized as this is an Alpha build. Expect bugs! 🐛🐜🐞

Q: How do I use this app?
A: Type in your Cherp Username and Password, then press Login. When successful, a service notification will show up telling you it's polling for unreads, and now, you wait!

Q: The app crashed when I tapped 'Login' :(
A: Check your Internet Connection! Alternately, Cherp servers may be down for maintenance. If neither seems to be the issue, it might be a bug.

Q: What do I do when something doesn't work?
A: Create a bug report at https://github.com/Talos0248/Cherp-Notify-Android/issues

Q: I saw an unread on the cherp.chat page, but the app doesn't notify me.
A: It takes upwards of 20 seconds (subject to change) for the app to update. Altrernately, it could just be a bug.
