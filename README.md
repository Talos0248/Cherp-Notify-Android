# Cherp Notify: The Android Version!
Cherp unread notifications, delivered straight to your Android device!

### FAQ
Q: Where/How do I download this?
> A: Find the latest release here: https://github.com/Talos0248/Cherp-Notify-Android/releases and download the apk file under 'Assets'. Install and enjoy!

Q: Why does play protect say that the app is unsafe?
> A: The app hasn't been signed, thus Google Play doesn't recognize it. To install, tap 'more details' and then 'install anyways'.

Q: Wait wait wait, is this malware if Google says it's unsafe????
> A: You have my 100% guarantee that this isn't a malware/virus. However, the code itself might be buggy/unoptimized as this is an Alpha build. Expect bugs! ­ЪљЏ­Ъљю­Ъљъ

Q: How do I use this app?
> A: Type in your Cherp Username and Password, then press Login. When successful, a service notification will show up telling you it's polling for unreads, and now, you wait! Feel free to close the app in the meantime, the service works in the background!

Q: I don't see any notification after pressing login...
> A: It might take up to 20 seconds for the notification to show up. If there is still nothing, manually check the App Info to make sure Notifications for the app are turned on.

Q: The app crashed when I tapped 'Login' :(
> A: Check your Internet Connection! Alternately, Cherp servers may be down for maintenance. If neither seems to be the issue, it might be a bug.

Q: What do I do when something doesn't work?
> A: Create a bug report at https://github.com/Talos0248/Cherp-Notify-Android/issues

Q: I saw an unread on the cherp.chat page, but the app doesn't notify me.
> A: It takes upwards of 20 seconds (subject to change) for the app to update. If you've opened the unread within the 20 seconds, the app won't send a notification. Alternately, it could just be a bug.

Q: The notification says I got an IC unread, but I actually got an OOC unread instead (or vice versa)
> A: There's currently two known causes for this: (1) Your partner edited the post from IC to OOC (or vice versa) which can't be detected by the API, or (2) the Cherp Unread API is acting up, which is something I can't really change
